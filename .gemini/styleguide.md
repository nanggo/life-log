# Gemini Code Assist Style Guide

# Life Log - SvelteKit Blog Project

## Review Philosophy

**Learning-Focused Approach**: Provide educational feedback that explains the "why" behind suggestions, not just the "what" to fix. Focus on helping the developer understand concepts and improve systematically.

**Iterative Improvement**: Prioritize high-impact suggestions over minor style issues. Break feedback into manageable chunks that can be implemented and learned from progressively.

**Context-Aware**: Consider the specific needs of this SvelteKit blog project, including performance optimization, SEO, accessibility, and maintainability.

## Priority Framework

### CRITICAL Priority (üö®)

- Missing documentation for complex logic
- Optimization opportunities for better developer experience
- Consistency with established patterns

### LOW Priority (‚ú®)

- Minor style inconsistencies
- Variable naming improvements
- Comment formatting
- Optional refactoring suggestions

## Technology Stack Standards

### SvelteKit & Svelte

- **Components**: Use `<script lang="ts">` for all components
- **Reactivity**: Prefer reactive statements (`$:`) over imperative updates
- **Stores**: Use stores for state that needs to be shared across components
- **Performance**: Implement virtual scrolling for large lists (>15 items)
- **SSR**: Ensure all components work with server-side rendering
- **File Structure**: Follow SvelteKit conventions for routes and components

### TypeScript

- **Strict Mode**: Maintain strict TypeScript configuration
- **Type Safety**: Avoid `any` type; use proper type definitions
- **Interfaces**: Define interfaces for complex data structures
- **Generics**: Use generics for reusable components and utilities
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error types and handling

### Performance Optimization

- **Virtual Scrolling**: Use VirtualList component for large datasets
- **Image Optimization**: Implement lazy loading and responsive images
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize JavaScript bundle sizes
- **Core Web Vitals**: Maintain good LCP, FID, and CLS scores
- **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies

### Security Standards

- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize all user inputs and dynamic content
- **Content Security Policy**: Maintain strict CSP headers
- **Input Validation**: Validate all external data sources
- **Dependency Security**: Keep dependencies updated and secure
- **Data Exposure**: Never expose sensitive information in client code

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose
- **ARIA Labels**: Provide appropriate ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Focus Management**: Implement proper focus management for dynamic content
- **Color Contrast**: Maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- **Touch Targets**: Ensure minimum 44px touch target size for mobile

### CSS & Styling (Tailwind CSS)

- **Utility-First**: Use Tailwind utilities over custom CSS when possible
- **Responsive Design**: Implement mobile-first responsive design
- **Dark Mode**: Support both light and dark themes
- **Performance**: Minimize custom CSS and leverage Tailwind's optimization
- **Consistency**: Use design tokens for consistent spacing and colors

### Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for utility functions and complex logic
- **Component Tests**: Test component behavior and user interactions
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Coverage**: Maintain reasonable test coverage for critical paths
- **E2E Tests**: Implement end-to-end tests for key user journeys

## Code Organization

### File Structure

```

```

### Component Guidelines

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose
- **Props Interface**: Define clear TypeScript interfaces for component props
- **Event Handling**: Use Svelte's event system appropriately
- **Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance
- **Documentation**: Document complex components with clear examples

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure the app works even when features fail
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages to users
- **Logging**: Implement appropriate error logging for debugging
- **Recovery**: Provide ways for users to recover from errors
- **Validation**: Validate inputs at component boundaries

## Review Guidelines for Gemini

### Educational Feedback
